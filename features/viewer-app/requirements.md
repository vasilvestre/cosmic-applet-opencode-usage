# Viewer App Scaffolding - Requirements

## Overview
A standalone COSMIC application for viewing historical OpenCode usage data, sharing database infrastructure with the existing applet.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Application Initialization
**FR-1.1**: The system SHALL create a standalone COSMIC application binary named "cosmic-applet-opencode-usage-viewer"

**FR-1.2**: WHEN the viewer application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database connection using the shared DatabaseManager

**FR-1.3**: WHEN the viewer application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the UsageRepository for data access

**FR-1.4**: IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit gracefully

### FR-2: Application Window
**FR-2.1**: The system SHALL display a window with the title "OpenCode Usage History"

**FR-2.2**: The system SHALL set the default window size to 1000x700 pixels

**FR-2.3**: The system SHALL allow the window to be resized by the user

**FR-2.4**: The system SHALL remember window size and position across sessions

### FR-3: User Interface
**FR-3.1**: The system SHALL display an empty content area in the main window (placeholder for future historical data display)

**FR-3.2**: The system SHALL provide a menu bar with application menus

**FR-3.3**: The system SHALL provide a "File" menu with an "Exit" option

**FR-3.4**: WHEN the user selects "Exit" from the File menu THEN the system SHALL close the application

### FR-4: Code Reuse
**FR-4.1**: The system SHALL reuse the existing DatabaseManager implementation from the applet

**FR-4.2**: The system SHALL reuse the existing UsageRepository implementation from the applet

**FR-4.3**: The system SHALL share the same database file location with the applet

**FR-4.4**: The system SHALL NOT interfere with the applet's functionality when running concurrently

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
**NFR-1.1**: The system SHALL launch within 2 seconds on a standard desktop system

**NFR-1.2**: The system SHALL initialize the database connection within 500 milliseconds

### NFR-2: Reliability
**NFR-2.1**: The system SHALL handle database access errors gracefully without crashing

**NFR-2.2**: The system SHALL properly clean up resources when the application exits

### NFR-3: Maintainability
**NFR-3.1**: The system SHALL follow the same code organization patterns as the existing applet

**NFR-3.2**: The system SHALL include SPDX license headers in all source files

**NFR-3.3**: The system SHALL pass all clippy lints with pedantic warnings enabled

**NFR-3.4**: The system SHALL include comprehensive unit and integration tests

### NFR-4: Compatibility
**NFR-4.1**: The system SHALL build using the same dependencies as the applet

**NFR-4.2**: The system SHALL run on the same platforms as the COSMIC desktop environment

**NFR-4.3**: The system SHALL use the libcosmic UI framework for consistency with COSMIC desktop

## Testing Requirements

### TR-1: Unit Tests
**TR-1.1**: The system SHALL include a test verifying ViewerApp creation

**TR-1.2**: The system SHALL include a test verifying database connection initialization

**TR-1.3**: The system SHALL include a test verifying repository access

### TR-2: Integration Tests
**TR-2.1**: The system SHALL include an integration test verifying the application can be built

**TR-2.2**: The system SHALL ensure all existing tests continue to pass (189+ tests)

## Out of Scope
- Historical data display (covered in separate feature)
- Data filtering and search (future feature)
- Data export functionality (future feature)
- Settings and preferences (future feature)
